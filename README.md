# Kenyan Flag Drawing with Python Turtle

This Python code utilises the Turtle module to visually represent the Kenyan flag. The code draws the flag's colours, geometric shapes, cultural symbols (shields, spears), and includes text descriptions explaining the symbolism behind each element. Users can interact with the flag by clicking on specific areas to reveal additional information about its symbolism.

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the provided code into a Python environment or script.
3. Run the script to generate the visual representation of the Kenyan flag.

## Usage and Click Functionality
This code enables user interaction with the flag by clicking on different areas, revealing symbolic explanations:
- Click on the black, red, white, or green sections to learn about their symbolism.
- Explore the Maasai Shield and Spears to understand their cultural significance.
- The click event handling function (`after_click()`) triggers information display based on the clicked areas.


## Functionality
- The code utilises the Turtle module to draw rectangles of different colours, representing various parts of the Kenyan flag.
- Functions like `shield()` and `arrow()` draw cultural symbols (shield, spears, arrows) and elements behind the shield, respectively.
- The `after_click()` function handles click events, displaying additional information about the flag's symbolism based on the clicked areas.
